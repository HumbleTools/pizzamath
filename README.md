# PizzaMath

A small calculator to convert and calculate bread recipes. It allows expressing quantities in ingredient-to-flower ratio (as bakers do), or in grams, as we usually do as home cooks. But it converts data both ways for convenience.

- Fill in the recipe you chose, in baker mode or home cook mode.
- Adjust the number of final dough balls you wish.
- Use baker mode to tweak the recipe as bakers do.
- Initial values are set for a neapolitan pizza dough.

This is a simple html page pulling VueJS to operate.

Enjoy !
